        <p className={classes.terms__text}>
          EatChefs may offer discount promotions, free/discounted trials, or other types of vouchers (“Vouchers”). In
          order to utilize the offer on the Voucher, users need to create an Account through the Site or App and input
          their information and the code found on the Voucher to redeem. If you purchase any Voucher, Voucher is deemed
          to have been sold at the time of payment for it. The discount found on the Voucher only lasts for the first
          week of your subscription plan, unless it specifically states otherwise on the Voucher or when you sign-up.
          Similarly, a Voucher may only be used once and may not be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published either
          directly or indirectly in any form or stored in data retrieval systems without our prior written approval.
          Additionally, Vouchers are only for first-time users of EatChefs, unless the Voucher states otherwise.
          EatChefs reserves the right to withdraw or deactivate any Voucher (other than one which has been purchased)
          for any reason, at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, and in accordance of the foregoing sentence, EatChefs
          reserves the right to withdraw or deactivate any of your outstanding referral credits or similar Vouchers in
          the event your referral code is posted to a third party website (excluding your own social media profile(s) or
          blogs), or if you otherwise violate this Agreement. Vouchers may only be redeemed through our Site or App, and
          not through any other website or method of communication. To use your Voucher, you will be required to enter
          its unique code at the online checkout and use of such code will be deemed to confirm your agreement to this
          Agreement and any special conditions attached to the Voucher. Pursuant to this Agreement, at the expiration of
          the Voucher, you agree and acknowledge that you will be billed the standard rate for your Meal Kit on a
          recurring, weekly basis, unless you cancel your Plan prior to the end of the Voucher period with proper,
          advance notice to EatChefs in accordance with this Agreement. As a part of the verification process, EatChefs
          may require you to provide additional identification information. In addition, as a part of the verification
          process, you authorize EatChefs to charge to your credit card, or other payment method, a EUR 1.00
          authorization charge (or such other amount identified to customer at time of verification by EatChefs), which
          amount will be refunded following successful authorization.

        <div>
          <p className={classes.terms__text}>
            <b>10.1 EatChefs Delivery Week.</b> EatChefs’s “Delivery Week” begins on Saturday and runs through the
            following Friday. The start of our Delivery Week means that new Meal Kits are available to be delivered in
            your Meal Box.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.terms__text}>
            <b>10.2 Rolling Basis of Meal Selection. </b> You have the option of selecting the day you would like to
            receive your Meal Box, and, if your specific subscription allows for Meal Kit selection, you also have the
            option of selecting the specific Meal Kits you would like to receive, on a weekly basis. The day you select
            to receive your first Meal Box will be the default. In subsequent weeks, if you do not make a change, your
            Meal Box will arrive on the day you initially selected every week (unless you pause your order, pursuant to
            these Terms, or there are extenuating circumstances, detailed in these Terms). If you choose to have your
            delivery on another day for a specific week, that day will become the default, and subsequent weeks will
            have your Meal Box arriving on the newly selected day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meal Kit selection and delivery day selection is on a rolling basis, and all selections “lock” five days
            prior to the delivery day. For example, if your subscription allows for Meal Kit selection and you receive
            your Meal Box on Fridays, you will have to make your selection of Meal Kits you want included in your Meal
            Box on Sunday by 11:59 PM CET. Your credit card or other payment source will then be charged the following
            day. Similarly, if you want to change the delivery day, you will have to make your selection five days prior
            to your new delivery day. For example, if you normally receive your Meal Box on Thursdays, but want to
            receive your Meal Box on a Monday, you will have to make the change five days prior to Monday, which would
            be the Wednesday of the previous week. Please note that the specific days in which a Meal Box can be
            delivered varies by geographic region, and delivery on each day will not be available in all areas. If you
            have any questions about your area and delivery, please contact Customer Care at info@eatchefs.com.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.terms__text}>
            <b>10.3 Deactivation Procedures.</b> Please note that the ability to change an order locks five days prior
            to your scheduled delivery date. Therefore, if you wish to deactivate your Account and/or cancel or change
            an order, you must do so before the day and time listed above for your respective delivery date. For
            example, if you have a scheduled delivery date on Tuesday, you have until Thursday at 11:59 PM CET to cancel
            your subscription. If you do so after the time listed for your delivery day, you will be charged and receive
            your Meal Box for that week, and the cancellation will take effect for the following Delivery Week. To
            deactivate your Account, please email info@eatchefs.com stating that you wish to terminate your account,
            along with your full name and registered email address. Where required, you may also deactivate your Account
            by accessing your Account on the EatChefs website.

          <p className={classes.terms__text}>
            <b>10.4 Pausing your Order.</b> During any production week, you have the option of pausing your deliveries.
            In order to do so, log on to your account page on the Site or App, select a particular week (by clicking on
            the delivery day highlighted) and then click on the “Pause Week” button. You will not be charged for any
            week in which your order is paused. Please note that this action cannot be taken for any scheduled order
            which has already “Locked,” pursuant to Section 10.2. Additionally, pausing an order shall only apply to the
            week in which you pause, and automatic deliveries will commence the following week, unless you choose to
            pause the following week, subject to the details, above.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.terms__text}>
            <b>10.5 Delivery Specifics.</b> In the case of weather which inhibits the ability to make safe deliveries,
            or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your order, we will attempt to
            deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur on a date other than
            your scheduled delivery day. If the delivery of your Meal Box is not feasible, we will cancel your delivery
            for the period so affected and issue you a credit, as determined in our sole discretion or refund of a part
            or the whole of the purchase price for that Meal Box.

        <h2 className={classes.terms__subtitle}>12. RECEIPT OF THE MATERIALS AND FOOD PREPARATION</h2>
        <p className={classes.terms__text}>
          EatChefs uses specific materials to refrigerate perishable items and also uses third party delivery companies
          to deliver Meal Boxes to customers. Please note that you are responsible for reviewing the Meal Box upon
          delivery and inspecting all of the Products contained within for any defects or other problems upon delivery.
          If you are not home when your Meal Box is delivered, the Meal Box will be left at your door or in a common
          area. Upon the completion of your review of the Meal Box, we recommend that you place all perishables in your
          refrigerator to ensure the ingredients’ integrity. All items are solely at your risk from the time of
          delivery. As such, you are solely responsible for any preparatory steps, storage of the contents of any Meal
          Kits, safe washing (we recommend that all fresh produce is washed prior to inclusion in any meal), and the
          cooking of all the ingredients of the respective Meal Kits. We recommend that you use a thermometer to measure
          the temperature of any poultry, fish, or meat products that arrive in the insulated portion of the Meal Box,
          and, pursuant to General Dutch Food Guidelines, you should utilize said thermometer to ensure that chilled
          foods are at (or below) 7 degrees Celsius and warm foods are above 60 degrees Celsius when delivered. EatChefs
          recommends that all cooking instructions found in the recipe booklet be followed, and all seafood, meats, and
          poultry should be cooked to at least the USDA’s recommended internal temperatures (75 degrees Celsius for
          poultry; 75 degrees Celsius for ground meats; 65 degrees Celsius for whole meats; and 65 degrees Celsius for
          seafood). EatChefs recommends utilizing a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures. For more
          information, please see the USDA’s website or the website of the The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product
          Safety Authority (NVWA), www.nvwa.nl).

            govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding,
            you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to:
            EatChefs, c/o Legal Department, Minervalaan 56-2, 1077PD, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The arbitration will
            be conducted by the NAI, an established alternative dispute resolution provider in Rotterdam, the

            administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than
            EUR 1,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Any judgment on the award rendered by
